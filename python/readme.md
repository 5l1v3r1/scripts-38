##portscan.py

Taken from the Violent Python book with modifications. I wasn't too happy with just retyping existing code. I don't learn well that way. Anywho, it was an exercise on how to space things out, how it worked and how I could modify something. 

##httpgrab.py

I've created this script from scratch. It'll be a working progress I'm sure. Just grabs the HEADER, OPTIONS and sends a GET request to the desired webserver on port 80. Excuse the messy functions. I'm sure there's a way of grouping them together, but for now it works at least.
