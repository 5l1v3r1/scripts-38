# Scripts

A centralised place for anything I knock up in BASH or whatever else I feel useful. 

##Ping Sweeper
A ping sweeper that takes an IP or IP Range as an input, passes it to Nmap and outputs 'Up' hosts to the screen.

##Zone Transfer
Takes input of domain/URL and runs a dig command and outputs to screen.

##Pentest Scans
A working project that incorporates both of the above scans into one BASH script.
